# Tile Game Maker
#### Javascript / HTML5 library and editor for pseudo-8-bit tile-based game creation

#### ⭐ Description:
#### (This project is a complete rewrite of the C# project [TileGameMaker](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameMaker) in Javascript and HTML5)

This project is designed for the development of "pseudo-8-bit" tile-based games. It was heavily inspired by two classic game engines: [ZZT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZT) and [MegaZeux](https://github.com/AliceLR/megazeux), as well as early 8-bit computer systems such as the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) and [Atari 800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family). A more recent game engine called [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) is also a source of inspiration.
